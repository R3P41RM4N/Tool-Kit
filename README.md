# Tool-Kit
This repo is a living document supporting my education in Offensive Cybersecurity/Penetration testing. Whenever I find useful information/tools I'm going to add it to my **Tool-Kit** with an example and a narrative on some of it's uses. I will expand it as I codify additional lessons learned. Please feel free to add information or updates if you want to contribute.
