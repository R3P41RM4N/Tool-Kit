CMD commands for the Windows command prompt
     https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/know-how/windows-cmd-commands/
     Great table that I want to include in my tool kit when I figure out how to put tables

An A-Z Index of Windows CMD commands.

    Very useful in terms of finding the right command for the job!
